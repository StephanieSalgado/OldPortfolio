                  fondness for playing music. I learned guitar and piano on my own, but I also play ukulele, cello, kalimba, recorder, flute, and accordion. Sometimes, I also make my own tab.

                <p style="color: black;"><strong>Being bilingual isn't enough.</strong> My first language was Spanish. I learned English through school and now it's the language I use most. 
                  However, I have always been fascinated by different languages. I can't speak any of the languages I've tried learning with complete fluency, but I can handle myself well in the romance languages. 
                  My French is pretty good considering I don't have much practice, and my Italian is usually good. A language like Portugese can get a little confusing because so many of the words sounds very similar to Spanish 
                  words I already know by heart. The languages I have learned (at various different levels) include: Albanian, Arabic, Catalan, English, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Portugese, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish.
